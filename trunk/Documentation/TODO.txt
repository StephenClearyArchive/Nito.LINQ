. Compatibility for Rx:
  . Repeat (sequences)
  . Run
  . Scan
  . SelectMany
  . StartWith
  . Zip
  . Defer/Let?

. Document compilation #defs:
  . SILVERLIGHT3 - for SL3
  . NET35 - for .NET 3.5 SP1
  . NET40 - for .NET 4.0
  . WITHRX - with Rx
. Unit tests may standardize on NET35, but must be run both WITHRX and !WITHRX
. Verify all comment restrictions, e.g., SortedListExtensions.Take.count, and also propogate all exception notes.
. Split out all non-extension methods and extension methods for collections of collections, and place them in separate EnumerableSource/ListSource/SortedEnumerableSource/SortedListSource classes.
. Document checkout sequence: build and test (with coverage) for every configuration.
. Review all unit tests and their names (some operators have been renamed and the unit tests are out of sync)
  . Ensure all types are explicit or constrained (ISortedEnumerable<int> or AsSortedEnumerable()).
