. Finish unit tests.
. Verify all comment restrictions, e.g., SortedListExtensions.Take.count, and also propogate all exception notes.
. Conversions to/from IList. Cast/ToConcreteIList (ToObjectIList?). Optional parameters for IsFixedSize/IsReadOnly as necessary.
. Document for every list/sorted list operator which resulting lists support insertion/sorted-insertion (sorted only)/removal/updating.
. Consider: ArgumentNullException checks
. Rename LexicographicalComparer to SequenceComparer and add a SequenceCompare algorithm (with IComparer<T> overload).

. Document compilation #defs:
  . SILVERLIGHT3 - for SL3
  . NET35 - for .NET 3.5 SP1
  . NET40 - for .NET 4.0
  . WITHRX - with Rx
. Document release sequence: build and test (with coverage) for every configuration.

Conceptual documentation:
. SequenceEqual/SequenceCompare vs IStructuralEquatable/IStructuralComparable
